# Installation

Copy the `ZEN_THEME.md` file into your [Silverbullet.md](https://silverbullet.md/) space folder and reload (`Ctrl+Alt+R` or via Command Picker `System: Reload`).

Make sure you have no conflicting styles.

> [!NOTE]
> Light theme will come later.
> Let me know about commonly used plugins and I will include them.
